# Cloudmesh Multi Cloud Open API Interface

Cloudmesh-storage also provides an OpenAPI specification that allows users to 
run the multi cloud storage services using a single REST service in addition 
to the command line interface. 

The REST service is developed independent of the storage service provider and 
users can switch between providers by setting the `storage` variable as 
follows:

```bash
$ cms set storage='azureblob'
```

`azureblob` can be replaced with the desired service in the above command.

To invoke the server, navigate to the OpenAPI folder in the 
cloudmesh-storage directory and use:

```bash
$ cms openapi server start ./openapi_storage.yaml
```

to start up the server on the default address and port. Once the server is 
started all cloudmesh-storage functions can be accessed using the following 
endpoints.

```bash
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/put
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/get
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/list
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/search
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/delete
http://localhost:8080//cloudmesh/storage/v1/create_dir
```

All of the options described in the `cloudmesh-storage` section are available 
in the OpenAPI specification as arguments. For example, to list the files 
from a specific directory on the service, the following URL can be visited:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/cloudmesh/storage/v1/list?service={storage}&directory=%2fapitest&recursive=True
```

## Pytests

A generic pytest is also developed which is available in the following directory

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-storage/tree/master/cloudmesh/storage/spec/tests>


The geneeric pytest that works accross providers and can be invoked as follows

```bash
$ cms set storage=azureblob
$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_openapi_storage.py

$ cms set storage=box
$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_openapi_storage.py

$ cms set storage=gdrive
$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_openapi_storage.py

$ cms set storage=awss3
$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_openapi_storage.py
```
