# Cloudmesh Yaml file Encrytion (TODO)

> THIS SECTION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND THE CONTENT DESCRIBED IS NOT YET WORKING

The cloudmesh yaml file can contain some information to simplify authentication.
IN order not tos store the file in cleartext we have provided a replacement
function for the configuration that allows encruption of the file with your ssh
key. IT is important that your ssh key is generated with a passphrase. If you do
not, even if you encrypt, the file can without a passphrase decrypted which is
the same as having it in cleartext. SO make sure tour ssh-key has a passphrase.

```https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cloud/blob/master/tests/test_encryption.py```

## Generating the Key and Certificate

We can encrypt and decrypt files using generated random key as follows:


First, you need to create a public-private key with a passphrase. THis can be
achieved with the `cms key` command it assumes that you have not jet created a key

```bash
cms config ssh keygen
```

Alternatively you can craete a key as follows

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m pem
```

In case you need to convert your key, to a pem certificate you can do it as follows

```
$ openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem
```

## Validate and verify the key

To validate the key please use the cms command

```bash
$ cms config check
$ cms config verify
```

## Encryption

To encrypt the file, pleas use the command

```bash
$ cms config encrypt 
```

This command will encrypt your `cloudmesh4.yaml` file and place it under
`~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4.yaml.enc`. It will ask you if you like to delete the orignial yaml file. 

## Decryption

To decrypt the file, pleas use the command

```bash
$ cms config decrypt 
```

This command will decrypt your `cloudmesh4.yaml.enc` file and place it under
`~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4.yaml.enc.enc`. It will ask you if you like to delete the orignial yaml file. 

## Cloudmesh Integration

We have provided a new `cloudmesh.management.configuration.ConfigCrypt()` That
will be integrated in future (once verified it works) into the regular `Config()`

The functionality tht is provided by  `ConfigCrypt()` includes

* if `cloudmesh4.yaml` and `cloudmesh4.yaml.enc` exist a warning is written that
  both files exist and it recommended in production to delete the unencrypted
  file.

* if only `cloudmesh4.yaml` exist a warning is written that an unencrypted yaml
  file is used

* if only `cloudmesh4.yaml.enc` exists it is unencrypted and loded into memory.
  Please note that `ConfigCrypt()` just as Config() is implemented as Borg class
  so that the decryption and loading loading is conducted only once.
 
## Editing the Configuration file

Editing the configuration file can be done by first unencrypting the file with 

```bash
$ TBD
```

Than yo ucan use your favourit editor to make modifications. Let us assume thsi
is emacs.

```bash
emacs ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4.yaml
```

Once written back quit your editor and encrypt the file with 

```bash
cms config encrypt

```

## Adding information to the configuration

It is also possible to add configurations to the encrypted file while storing
the new values in a temporary yaml file.

Let us assume the temporary file `./change.yaml` contains the following information:

```
cloudmesh:
  profile:
    firstname: Gregor
    lastname: von Laszewski
```

Than the command


```bash
cms config add ./change.yaml

```

Will update the existing `cloudmesh4.yaml` or cloudmesh4.yaml.enc` file with the
provided information. This is taking place regardless if the yaml file  is
encrypted or not. If both files exist., both files will be modified. A Wrning is
however issued if the unencrypted yaml file esists to remind the user to delete
it.

Alternatively the convenient dot notation cloudmesh provides for configuration
files can be used. This is done by having the ending `txt` instead of `yml`
We illustarted this on the following example where the data is stored in `change.txt`

```
cloudmesh.profile.firstname: Gregor
cloudmesh.profile.lastname: von Laszewski
```

```bash
cms config add ./change.txt

```


## Separating the sensitive information

As it may be beneficial to separate the sensitive form the non sensitive
information, we also provide a mechanism for authentication with a merged file.
This way you could for example store the sensitive information on a USB key.

For this to work we specify in the yaml file a field called

```bash
cloudmesh:
  encrypted: ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4-secrets.yaml.enc

```

You can name the file anything you like and you could point it to your location
of the USB key.

in this file we store only the sensitive information such as

```bash
cloudmesh.storage.azure.credentials.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: 'xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

PLease note that we leverage the convenient dot notation cloudmesh provides for
configuration files so we can formulate the value in a single line>
